# DS3231
C Library for interfacing DS3231 Real Time Clock with AVR MCUs.

Still something to do, but yet working if there is only need for reading/writing time and date.

## Dependencies
This library depends on the API of Denis Goriachevs [i2c_avr](https://github.com/chrisgoertz/i2c_avr) library.
I removed the status to string error message stuff, since i don't need this
functionality.
